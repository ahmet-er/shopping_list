What is localStorage / sessionStorage?
    - Property on `Window`interface that allows us to access a Storage object 
    - Data is stored in the browser
    - Data is stored as key/value pairs and values are strings (can not store objects)

localStorage and sessionStorage have the same API. The difference is that localStorage does not expire, while sessionStorage only lasts until the page closed
